Instruction to run the code: 
The file code that implements the Iterative Deepening Depth First Search algorithm is isabella_poles_iddfs.py

Compiler used to run the code: python 3.7

The code can be run from the command line simply positioning on the current directory where the file is present typing isabella_poles_iddfs.py and then as initial configuration the desired input string. 
Example: 
python isabella_poles_iddfs.py 
initial configuration: 1 0 2 4 5 7 3 8 9 6 11 12 13 10 14 15

The results are printed in the form of:
- moves leading to the solution
- number of nodes expanded
- total computation time
- total memory usage
Example for the initial configuration 1 0 2 4 5 7 3 8 9 6 11 12 13 10 14 15:
Solution found:
Moves history: ['R', 'D', 'L', 'D', 'D', 'R', 'R']
Number of nodes expanded: 4292
Total time taken: 0.056844234466552734 s
Total memory usage:  76.0 KB

Instruction to run the code: 
The file code that implements the Breadth-First-Search algorithm is isabella_poles_bfs.py

Compiler used to run the code: python 2.7

The code can be run from the command line simply positioning on the current directory where the file is present typing isabella_poles_bfs.py followed by the input string. 
Example: python isabella_poles_bfs.py "1 0 2 4 5 7 3 8 9 6 11 12 13 10 14 15"

The results are printed in the form of:
- moves leading to the solution
- number of nodes expanded
- total computation time
- total memory usage
Example for the initial configuration "1 0 2 4 5 7 3 8 9 6 11 12 13 10 14 15":
Moves history: RDLDDRR
Number of nodes expanded: 5877
Total time taken: 0.6292805671691895 s
Total memory usage: 19914 kB

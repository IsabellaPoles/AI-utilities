# AI-utilities
A collection of Artificial Intelligence algorithms. 

This repository proposes some of the artificial intelligence algorithms described on the book _"Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach"_, from _Stuart Russel_ and _Peter Norvig_ implemented in Python.

The utilities implemented includes: 
- A* Search algorithm; 
- Breadth First Search algorithm; 
- Decision Tree algorithm; 
- Itarative Deepening A* Search algorithm; 
- Itarative Deepening Depth First Search algorithm; 
- Markov Decsion Process algorithm.

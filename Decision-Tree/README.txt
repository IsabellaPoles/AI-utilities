Instruction to run the code: 
The program requires as runtime input 2 arguments:
- The name of file from which to parse the data (for example 'restaurant.csv')
- The name of the target attribute (for example 'WillWait')

While the computation of the decision tree works also for target variables with more than 2 values, the pruning is limited to binary values.

IMPORTANT: the CSV file containing the data should be properly written, without any whitespace in the values. For the restaurant examples, the properly cleaned file can be found in this folder.
